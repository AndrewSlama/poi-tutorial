         <h2>Im not talking about the food! The Poi dance was originally used by the MƒÅori women for keeping their hands flexible for weaving and by the men for strength and coordination required during battle. Poi is also  performing art. Poi is learned not through formal education, but through community and self teaching are the keys to success. Thank you for checking out my page and hopefully you are able to gain some insights into your own poi adventure! Lets begin!</h2>
